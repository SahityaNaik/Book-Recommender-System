# Book-Recommender-System
 
 # Description

In today's digital age, the vast array of books available across genres poses a challenge for readers seeking personalized recommendations. To address this issue, we propose the development of a compact Book Recommender Mini Application, leveraging Machine Learning techniques.
The aim is to create a user-friendly platform that assists readers in discovering books aligned with their preferences and past interactions. The application consists of two core functionalities: a Popularity-Based Recommender and a Collaborative Filtering-Based Recommender.

# Datasets Used
